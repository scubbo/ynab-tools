Brief and incomplete list of tasks I'd like to accomplish

# Logic

- [ ] Permit looking back more than a single month to identify excess spending (either to identify trends, and/or to support non-monthly targets)
- [ ] Offer suggestion for what the new target should be (and automated updating it)

# Structure

- [ ] Factor logic out from interface
- [ ] Implement a dedicated well-typed `Client`

# Tooling and SDLC

- [ ] Auto-lint
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] mypy integration
- [ ] Auto-publish to pypi (logic already exists from the template, just need to provide authentication)
